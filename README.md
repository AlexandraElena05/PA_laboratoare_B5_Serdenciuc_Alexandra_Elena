For compulsory I did:
-the main frame 
-a ConfigPanel class for introducing parameters regarding the shapes that will be drawn: the size, the number of sides
-a DrawingPanel class for drawing a polygon with a specified number of sides and a random color where we click the mouse 
-a ControlPanel class for the buttons load, save, reset, exit
-and when I save I can specify where the image will be saved

For optional I did:
-I implemented a retained mode drawing and support for deleting shapes
-I implemented a new shape (circle) and when this shape is used, the panel adaps to the shape
-I implemented a free drawing mode where I can just draw different shapes and lines
